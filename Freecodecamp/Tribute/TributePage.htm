        Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel, better known as Coco Chanel, was a pioneering French fashion designer credited with revolutionizing fashion for women by introducing into their wardrobes more casual and comfortable styles.
        She is probably best known as the founder of the Chanel brand, and her designs include the Chanel suit, the little black dress, and the No. 5 perfume.

        Born on August 19, 1883, in Saumur, France, Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel grew up in an orphanage where she learned to sew. 
        She started her career as a singer in cafes, where she adopted the nickname "Coco." Chanel opened her first boutique in 1910 and quickly became a key figure in Parisian fashion. 
        She was a trailblazer in creating simple, elegant clothing for women, moving away from the corseted, elaborate styles of the past. 
        Chanelâ€™s influence extended beyond fashion, with her signature fragrance, Chanel No. 5, becoming a timeless symbol of luxury. 
        She passed away on January 10, 1971, but her legacy continues to shape modern fashion.
